# LINQPad Starter Pack for .NET Developers  
_A modular playground for exploring LINQ, EF Core, and real-world prototyping_

## 🎯 Overview

This repository is a curated collection of **LINQPad snippets** designed to help .NET developers rapidly prototype, explore, and teach core concepts using C# in LINQPad’s **C# Program** mode. Each snippet is modular, self-contained, and organized by category to support learning, debugging, and educational content creation.

Whether you're experimenting with ASCII logic, refining string manipulation techniques, formatting dates, or querying databases with EF Core—this Starter Pack is your launchpad.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Build a reusable library of LINQPad `.linq` files for ASCII logic, string manipulation, date/time formatting, and EF Core querying  
- Support educational outreach through GitHub, YouTube tutorials, and eLearning platforms like Udemy and Pluralsight  
- Provide clean, teachable examples for developers exploring LINQ, EF Core, and Syncfusion UI components  
- Archive learning milestones and modular utilities for future reference and content creation

## 🧠 Coming Soon

- EF Core query playgrounds  
- Syncfusion UI scaffolds (Cards, DataGrid, Buttons)  
- LINQ fundamentals and filtering patterns  
- Notion-based content management templates  
- YouTube walkthroughs and course outlines
